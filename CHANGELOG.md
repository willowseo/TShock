# TShock for Terraria

This is the rolling changelog for TShock for Terraria. Use past tense when adding new entries; sign your name off when you add or change something. This should primarily be things like user changes, not necessarily codebase changes unless it's really relevant or large.

## TShock 4.3.10

* API: Added crash protection around malicious and/or invalid packets (@Wolfje)
* Fixed an issue adding a ban on a player who has previously been banned (@Wolfje)
* Fixed /invade martian (@Wolfje)

## TShock 4.3.8
* API: Update to Terraria 1.3.0.8 (@Patrikkk)
* **API: Added a crash reporter which collects memory dumps on Windows** (@Wolfje)
* API: New commandline param: `-crashdir` - Writes crash reports to the specified directory (@Wolfje)
* API: Sendq now doesn't disconnect people when it cant send a packet (@Wolfje)
* API: Fixed more crashes on disconnect in sendq (@Wolfje)
* API: Now ignores unknown server packets (@Wolfje)
* API: Potentially removed arithmetic overflows in server (@Wolfje)

### Using the Crash Reporter

TShock now has a crash reporter built in which writes crash logs to the `crashes` directory
in the event of a catastrophic failure.  **To change where TShock writes its crash logs,
specify the `-crashdir` parameter on the command line**.

1. In the event of a crash, look for a file called `crash_xxxx.zip` in the `crashes` directory
2. Upload the file somewhere, beware the crash file may be quite large (>100MB), anywhere like google drive, dropbox or mega will be fine
3. Post a link to the crash with reproduction steps in the TShock support forum

Alternatively, if you do not want to report the crash, just delete the file.
